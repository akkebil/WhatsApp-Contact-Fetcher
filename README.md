# WhatsApp Contact Fetcher
WhatsApp Contact Fetcher is a useful script designed to facilitate retrieving contacts from WhatsApp chat groups where no names are entered. Sometimes it happens that chat groups contain only phone numbers without associated names, which can make it difficult to organize and manage the contacts in an efficient way.

Using WhatsApp Contact Fetcher, you can quickly and easily extract phone numbers from the chat group and save them in either HTML or CSV format. This makes it possible to export and store your contacts in a structured way for further management or analysis.

The script works by navigating to the WhatsApp web app in your browser and selecting the specific chat group whose contacts you want to retrieve. When the script runs, a list of phone numbers is generated in the selected format, which can then be downloaded as a file to your device.

WhatsApp Contact Fetcher is user-friendly and saves valuable time and effort by automating the process of extracting contacts from chat groups. Whether you need to organize your contact list, transfer contacts to another platform or perform analysis on your WhatsApp contacts, this script provides a smooth solution.

Note that WhatsApp Contact Fetcher is independent of external web services or API keys and works directly in your browser, providing a secure and private solution for managing your WhatsApp contacts.

Save time and simplify the management of your WhatsApp contacts by using WhatsApp Contact Fetcher and get a structured list of contacts in an instant.
